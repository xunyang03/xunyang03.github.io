## Background
By analyzing the research status of focusing mechanisms of space remote sensing cameras, it can be seen
that due to the diversity of uses the particularity of application environments, there is currently 
no mature focusing mechanism that can meet the design requirements of **lightweight** and **simplified** structure.<br>
Thus, a new type of end-curved gear composite focusing mechanism was proposed by our research group. 
It has the dual advantages of gears and cam transmission mechanisms, which could replace traditional mechanisms
and improve mechanism reliability and maintainability. <br>

## Implementation
1. Determine the layout and parameters of the main components, determine the working principle, technical requirements;
2. Use Solidworks to complete the modeling and drawing of each part;
3. Kinematics simulation analysis based on Adams;
4. Verify the design through 3D printing of parts and assembly of physical prototypes.

## Result
The displacement during the experiment is not much different from the theoretical displacement. The average
measured distance is 7.15mm, which is 0.35mm different from the theoretical displacement, and the error is 4.7%.<br>
