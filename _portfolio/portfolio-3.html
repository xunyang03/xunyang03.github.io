In this lab, we worked on a 5-DOF robotic arm, focusing on building autonomy through computer vision techniques, kinematics, and path planning to enable object manipulation.

<b>Overview</b>
Armlab will have two fairly separate components:
<ul>
  <li>Computer vision, which involves</li>
    Camera calibration for an RGB-D camera
    Block detection
    Color detection
  <li>Kinematics, which involves</li>
    Forward Kinematics (FK) using DH tables or PoX
    Inverse Kinematics (IK)
