# INTERN EXPERIENCE
### Research Assistant
Soft Robotics Center, Shenzhen Institute of AI and Robotics (Airs), Shenzhen, China<div style="text-align: right;">*06/2024 – 08/2024*</div>
* Origami Structure Optimization\
Participated in the design optimization of the underwater deformable recovery robot (DUR), conducted kinematics analysis and parameter design of the origami structure. Established the maximum open-close area ratio model and the deploying dynamics model. Performed global optimization using the particle swarm algorithm.
* Thruster System Design\
Designed the position and orientation of the DUR thruster. Constructed a propulsion system model with a characteristic matrix. Evaluated overall maneuverability through SVD decomposition. Evaluated the maximum output of force through linear regression.
