## PROJECT EXPERIENCE
___
### ROB550 Course Project
**Group Member**, U-M Ford Robotics Building <span style="float: right;">*01/2024 – 04/2024*</span>
  * Background: A mandatory advanced robotics course at the University of Michigan requiring students to complete two practical projects in groups: a robotic arm and a SLAM car.
  * Implementation: **Robotic Arm Block Grasping**: Utilized Python and OpenCV for color block recognition, performed kinematics and inverse kinematics calculations for the robotic arm, enabling it to accurately locate and grasp the target. **SLAM Car**: Built a car equipped with a LiDAR, implemented PID control, filtering SLAM, and path planning.
  * Outcome: Achieved second place in the color block classification competition. The car successfully navigated through a maze, gaining proficiency in robotic vision, motion control, and SLAM technologies.

### Semi-Autonomous Snowplow Project
**Undergraduate Senior Design**, UC Center for Robotics Research <span style="float: right;">*09/2022 – 04/2023*</span>
  * Background: Developed a semi-autonomous snowplow capable of performing snow clearing tasks with minimal human intervention, intended for campus road maintenance.
  * Implementation: **Control**: Built a hardware platform using an Arduino board, employed a Kalman filter to fuse GPS and IMU data for improved localization accuracy, and implemented PID feedback for differential control of the wheels. **Algorithm**: Applied A* path planning and decision-making algorithms based on the ROS system.
  * Outcome: The vehicle demonstrated stable driving and turning, executed snowplow commands effectively, and successfully performed autonomous path following and waypoint cruising in a simulated environment.

### 2D LiDAR SLAM Research
